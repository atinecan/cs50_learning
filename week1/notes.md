# CS50 – Week 1: Introduction to Computer Science

## 1. What is Computer Science?

In this lecture, computer science is defined as the study of problem solving.
A computer itself is not intelligent, but it can execute instructions precisely and repeatedly.

One important idea introduced here is that:
> Computer science is not about computers, but about thinking systematically.

This was new to me, because before this course I associated computer science mainly with coding.

## 2. Binary and Data Representation

Computers represent all information using binary numbers (0 and 1).
This applies not only to numbers, but also to text, images, and sounds.

### Key points:
- Binary is a base-2 number system.
- Each binary digit (bit) represents a power of 2.
- Letters can be represented using ASCII codes.

At first, converting between decimal and binary felt unintuitive.
I needed some time to understand how each bit contributes to the final value.

## 3. Abstraction

Abstraction means hiding complexity in order to focus on higher-level concepts.
This allows programmers to build complex systems without understanding every low-level detail.

Example from the lecture:
- We use software libraries without knowing how they are implemented internally.

This concept reminded me of philosophical abstraction, where we simplify reality to make reasoning possible.

## 4. Problem Solving Process

The lecture emphasized a structured approach to problem solving:

1. Understand the problem
2. Break it down into smaller parts
3. Solve each part step by step
4. Combine the solutions

I realized that this process is very similar to how arguments are constructed in philosophy,
especially in logic and ethics.

## 5. Personal Reflection

This first week helped me realize that computer science is less about memorizing syntax
and more about developing a certain way of thinking.

My main challenge at this stage is:
- Getting used to technical terminology in English
- Thinking in a more precise and step-by-step manner

Despite this, I feel more confident starting this learning path,
because the way problems are approached feels intellectually familiar.
